# UBA

To find anomaly data points I tried to implement 3 anomaly detection algorithms.

KNN, Local Outlier Factor and Isolation Forest.

LOF and Isolation Forest results were the same.

Difference from KNN results was too small so I decided to ignore it and focus on those 2 algorithms.

The end result is a table with 5 columns:

1. Date <br>
2. Action name <br>
3. Account number <br>
4. Used value <br>
5. Maximum allowed value (for used value)
